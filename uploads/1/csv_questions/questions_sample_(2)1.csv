"You currently operate a web application in the AWS US-East region. The application runs
on an auto-scaled layer of EC2 instances and an RDS Multi-AZ database. Your IT security
compliance officer has tasked you to develop a reliable and durable logging solution to
track changes made to your EC2, IAM and RDS resources. The solution must ensure the
integrity and confidentiality of your log data. Which of the below solutions would you
recommend?","Create a new CloudTrail trail with one new S3 bucket to store the logs
and with the option that applies trail to all regions selected. Use IAM
roles, S3 bucket policies and Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) to
delete on the S3 bucket that stores your logs.","Create a new CloudTrail with one new S3 bucket to store the logs.
Configure SNS to send log file delivery notifications to your management
system. Use IAM roles and S3 bucket policies on the S3 bucket that stores
your logs.","Create a new CloudTrail trail with an existing S3 bucket to store the logs
and with the option that applies trail to all regions selected. Use S3 ACLs
and Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) to delete on the S3 bucket that
stores your logs","Create three new CloudTrail trails with three new S3 buckets to store the
logs one for the AWS Management console, one for AWS SDKs and one for
command line tools. Use IAM roles and S3 bucket policies on the S3",Option3,AWS Arch,5
"An enterprise wants to use a 3rd party SaaS application hosted by another AWS account.
The SaaS application needs to have access to issue several API commands to discover
Amazon EC2 resources running within the enterprise’s account. The enterprise has internal
security policies that require any outside access to their environment must conform to the
principles of least privilege and there must be controls in place to ensure that the
credentials used by the SaaS vendor cannot be used by any other third party.
Which of the following options would meet all of these conditions?","From the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Security Credentials
page and retrieve the access and secret key for your account","Create an IAM user within the enterprise account assign a user policy to the
IAM user that allows only the actions required by the SaaS application.
Create a new access and secret key for the user and provide these
credentials to the SaaS provider.","Create an IAM role for cross-account access that allows the SaaS
provider’s account to assume the role and assign it a policy that
allows only the actions required by the SaaS application.","Create an IAM role for EC2 instances, assign it a policy which allows only
the actions required for the Saas application to work, provide the role
ARN to the SaaS provider, to be used when launching their application
instances.",Option3,AWS Arch,5
"An AWS customer is deploying an application that is composed of an auto scaling group
of EC2 Instances. The customer's security policy requires that every outbound connection
from these instances to any other service within the customers Virtual Private Cloud must
be authenticated using a unique X.509 certificate that contains the specific instance ID. In
addition, an X.509 certificate must be designed by the AWS Key Management Service
(KMS) in order to be trusted for authentication.
Which of the following configurations will support these requirements?","Configure an IAM Role that grants access to an Amazon S3 object
containing a signed certificate and configure an Auto Scaling group to
launch instances with this role. Have the instances bootstrap, get the
certificate from Amazon S3 upon first boot.","Embed a certificate into the Amazon Machine Image that is used by the
Auto Scaling group Have the launched instances, generate a certificate
signature request with the instance’s assigned instance-id to the AWS KMS
for signature","Configure the AutoScaling group to send an SNS notification of the
launch of a new instance to the AWS Certificate Manager. Create a
signed certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).","Configure the launched instances to generate a new certificate upon first
boot. Have the AWS KMS poll the Auto Scaling group for associated
instances and send new instances a certificate signature (that contains the
specific instance-id).",Option3,AWS Arch,5
